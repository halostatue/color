# color Security Policy

## LLM-Generated Security Report Policy

Absolutely no security reports will be accepted that have been generated by LLM
agents.

## Supported Versions

Security reports are accepted for the most recent major release and the previous
version for a limited time after the initial major release version.

After a major release, the previous version will receive full support for three
months and security support for an additional three months (for a total of six
months).

Because color 1.x supports a wide range of Ruby versions that are themselves end
of life, security reports will only be accepted when they can be demonstrated on
Ruby 3.2 or higher.

> | Version | Release Date | Support Ends | Security Support Ends |
> | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- |
> | 1.x     | 2015-10-26   | 2025-11-07   | 2026-02-07            |
> | 2.x     | 2025-08-07   | -            | -                     |
