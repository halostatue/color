# Generates a monochromatic constrasting colour palette for background and
# foreground. What does this mean?
#
# Monochromatic: A single colour is used to generate the base palette, and
# this colour is lightened five times and darkened five times to provide
# eleven distinct colours.
#
# Contrasting: The foreground is also generated as a monochromatic colour
# palette; however, all generated colours are tested to see that they are
# appropriately contrasting to ensure maximum readability of the foreground
# against the background.
